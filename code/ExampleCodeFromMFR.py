This program works only with model DI-1100.
Disconnect any other instrument models to prevent the program from
detecting a different device model with a DATAQ Instruments VID and attempting to use it.
Such attempts will fail.
While the DI-1100's protocol is similar to model DI-2108, it doesn't support
a decimation function. Therefore, its minimum sample rate of ~915 Hz is
too fast for this program to work properly because of its heavy
use of print statements. The program overcomes that problem
through use of a 'decimation_factor' variable to slow scan rate to an
acceptable level.
The DI-1100 used with this program MUST be placed in its CDC communication mode.
Follow this link for guidance:

The DI-1100 protocol this program uses can be downloaded from the instrument's
product page:

"""
Since model DI-1100 cannot scan slower that 915 Hz at the protocol level,
and that rate or higher is not practical for this program, define a decimation
factor to slow scan rate to a practical level. It defines the number of analog readings to average
before displaying them. By design, digital input values display instantaneously
without averaging at the same rate as decimated analog values.
Averaging n values on each analog channel is more difficult than simply using
every nth value, but is recommended since it reduces noise by a factor of n^0.5
'decimation_factor' must be an integer value greater than zero.
'decimation_factor' = 1 disables decimation and attemps to output all values.
